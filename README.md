## Abstract 

The concentration of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) in the Earth’s atmosphere is
increasing. The main reason is agricultural activity, especially the application of nitrogenous
fertilisers and animal manures to soils. In tropical and subtropical climates, N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from
fertilised soils can be particularly high, however, there is considerable uncertainty in N<sub>2</sub>O estimates
as data coverage is poor. The research presented here aimed to close this knowledge gap and
investigate strategies for abating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from agricultural soils. This thesis focused on
animal manures because (i) intensive livestock production is expanding in tropical and subtropical
regions, and (ii) manures from intensive animal production are increasingly considered as
alternative nutrient sources for crops. N<sub>2</sub>O mitigation strategies were evaluated by amending soils
with geological or plant-derived materials that have shown potential to decrease N<sub>2</sub>O emissions
from agricultural soil in previous research but have not been studied extensively. Experiments
across different spatial scales (microcosm to field) have been conducted to investigate the
transferability of observed effects.

In the first study (Chapter 3), manures were applied to the soil surface as a simulation of no-till
farming practice using microcosm systems. It was hypothesised that adding bentonite, a clay with
ion adsorption capacity, would decrease N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from manures. Blends of bentonite with
beef, pig or poultry layer manure were applied to three different soils from South East Queensland
and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were quantified over three weeks. Contrary to expectations, blending bentonite with
manures tended to increase N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. This observation was interpreted as the combined effect
of increased moisture content at the soil surface caused by the strong water binding capacity of
bentonite and decreased oxygen concentrations in the soil due to restricted gas exchange. In the
following studies, bentonite was therefore incorporated into the soil rather than applied to the
surface.

The second study (Chapter 4) examined the effect of bentonite, biochar or green waste compost
additions on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from poultry litter at a commercial sugarcane farm. Sugarcane was
chosen because it is a major crop in Queensland and globally and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from sugarcane
soils can be high. Poultry litter and blends of poultry litter were applied subsurface along sugarcane
rows. Over ten months, fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O, and also CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> were quantified with static chambers.
The early phase of the field experiment was simulated in a parallel laboratory experiment. Biochar
addition to poultry litter decreased N<sub>2</sub>O emission in the field (-36%) and in the laboratory (-18%)
compared to poultry litter only application. Bentonite addition decreased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from
poultry litter in the field (-16%) but increased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the laboratory (+8%). Differences
in soil aeration caused by bentonite’s swelling-shrinking characteristics are the likely cause for 
these opposite effects in field and laboratory experimentation. Blending compost and poultry litter
increased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the field (+34%) and the laboratory (+286%) compared to poultry litter
only application. Compost addition increased nitrate levels in soil thus promoting N<sub>2</sub>O emissions
from denitrification. Furthermore, the fixed soil moisture of 60% water filled pore space (WFPS) in
the laboratory experiment would have created conditions more favourable for N<sub>2</sub>O production than
variable WFPS in field soil. The laboratory experiment was a useful indicator for treatment effects
but patterns of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes differed from those in the field, with explanations including the
variability of field soil moisture, amongst other differences. Emission factors of N<sub>2</sub>O calculated
from the field experiment ranged from 3.36% to 8.02%, which exceed the default emission factor of
1% for managed soils as given by the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and 1.25% for
sugarcane cropping as given by the Australian Department of Environment.

The third study (Chapter 5) examined the effect of bentonite and biochar on soil N dynamics to
investigate the underlying mechanisms of the N<sub>2</sub>O decreases observed in the field experiment and in
the scientific literature. A dose-response experiment was performed in microcosm systems in which
urea and poultry litter were blended with increasing rates of bentonite and biochar, respectively, and
applied to soil that had been sampled from the sugarcane field in Chapter 4. By using the minimally
invasive microdialysis technique, soil inorganic N fluxes were measured simultaneously to N<sub>2</sub>O
fluxes. Combining these two analyses had not been done before. Overall, N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from urea
and poultry litter decreased with both amendments, especially at high application rates.
Exchangeably-bound ammonium ions in the presence of both amendments reduced the flux rates of
ammonium and nitrate in soil and were a likely reason for the lower N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.

In summary, this thesis has generated empirical data and produced new insights into soil N turnover
processes. The results obtained (i) contribute to the revision of emission factors from cropping, (ii)
may improve N<sub>2</sub>O emission models that take variations in climate, soil and nutrient scenarios into
consideration, and (iii) provide foundations for abating reactive nitrogen losses from farming
systems using amendments.
